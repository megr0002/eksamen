        <h1>Content</h1>
        <p>In this course, we explored the comprehensive process of content creation, covering pre-production,
            production, and
            post-production stages. We gained hands-on experience in planning, shooting, and editing content while
            learning the
            importance of each phase in delivering high-quality results. During the pre-production stage, we focused on
            preparation,
            including planning shots, setting up equipment, and organizing interviews.</p>
        <p>In the production phase, we experimented with filming interviews, capturing high-quality video and audio
            while learning
            techniques to enhance visual storytelling. The post-production stage involved editing video, enhancing
            images, and
            refining audio using industry-standard tools such as Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Audition, and After Effects.
            We also
            experimented with color grading and visual effects, gaining insight into how these elements contribute to
            polished and
            engaging content.</p>

                <h2>Redesign of a website</h2>
                <p>For this assignment, we redesigned a company’s website by interviewing the owner of a local antique
                    store and capturing
                    photos and videos. Using research methods, prototypes, testing, wireframes, sitemaps, and layout
                    diagrams, we
                    streamlined the process to ensure the design met both the business’s goals and the needs of its
                    users.</p>
