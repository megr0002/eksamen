        <h1>Animation</h1>
        <p>In this course, we explored the fundamentals of animation, focusing on using JavaScript and CSS to create
            interactive
            and engaging visual elements. Through hands-on exercises, we learned how animation enhances user
            experiences,
            particularly in the context of game development. A significant emphasis was placed on the importance of
            style when
            designing game assets, including character and background design, to ensure a visually cohesive and
            appealing product.</p>
        <p>We also developed skills in Adobe Illustrator, enabling us to create high-quality assets for our projects.
            Additionally,
            we learned to create paper prototypes, which helped us map out the functionality and purpose of our games in
            a tangible
            way. To streamline the development process, we created activity diagrams, offering a structured overview of
            game
            mechanics, which made the coding process more efficient and organized.</p>

                <h2>Game design</h2>
                <p>For this assignment, we created an original "click" game with items, points, lives, and a timer. My
                    concept featured a
                    sleeping girl where the player had to collect teddy bears (good) while avoiding demons (bad).
                    Although illness prevented
                    me from fully designing characters or completing the project, I developed a prototype and did
                    animations using
                    JavaScript, and CSS using teacher-provided assets.</p>
