                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hi there! I'm Melanie Grath, a 21-year-old multimedia design student based in Slagelse, Denmark. I’ve
                    always had a deep
                    passion for creativity, which fuels both my work and my personal life. Whether I’m sketching in my
                    notebook,
                    experimenting with graphic design, or diving into a new book or movie, I’m constantly inspired by
                    the world around me.</p>
                <p>Currently, I’m studying multimedia design, where I get to blend my love for design with my technical
                    skills. Graphic
                    design, in particular, holds a special place in my heart, and I’m always eager to push my creative
                    boundaries and
                    explore new ways to express visual ideas.</p>
                <p>When I’m not immersed in design projects, you’ll find me enjoying a good book, taking care of my
                    plants, cooking,
                    drawing or getting lost in a captivating movie. These hobbies help me unwind and spark fresh
                    creative ideas that I bring
                    into my work.
                    Design isn't just what I do—it’s who I am. I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities
                    to grow, and I’d love
                    to collaborate on exciting projects that bring ideas to life.</p>
