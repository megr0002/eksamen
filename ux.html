        <h1>UX - User experience</h1>
        <p>In this course, we explored a variety of research methods to uncover user needs, behaviors, and motivations.
            These
            techniques provided valuable insights into understanding the customer or user base, as well as the
            businesses and their
            competitors. By analyzing this information, we gained a deeper comprehension of the factors influencing user
            experiences
            and decision-making processes.</p>
        <p>This knowledge is crucial for creating user-friendly designs that effectively address the needs of both users
            and
            businesses. It enables designers to strike a balance between user satisfaction and business objectives,
            resulting in
            solutions that are not only functional and appealing but also strategically aligned with the goals of the
            organization.</p>

                    To create this
                    successfully i did thorough research, mindmaps, moodboards and found the most important user
                    stories. I also made a
